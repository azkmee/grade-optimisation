# grade-optimisation

Excel sheet to help user select which subjects to not include in the overall GPA

Some universities will allow us to exempt some grades from the computation of the overal GPA. The job of choosing which modulesto exempt become harder when the weightage differes from the rest of the modules. In SUTD, we have modules that are half module in weightage and choosing to exempt based on their GPA will not maximize our GPA.

The excel file uses the solver tools to solve the binary linear programming where a binary variable is attached to each module that could be exempted. 

User only needs to fill in their grades and navigate through the solver to give show them the module they should exempt to maximise their GPA.

Good Luck!
